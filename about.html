  <h3>Inspired by the characteristics of an eagle</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Eagles fly with eagles at high altitudes and not with sparrows or any other small birds. 
<br><span class="link">Lesson: Stay away from people who discourage and offer you nothing towards your advancement.</span></li>
  <li>Eagles have a strong vision. They are able to focus on its prey up to five kilometres away, they narrow their focus on it and set out to get it despite all the obstacles.
 <br><span class="link">Lesson: Have a vision and remain focused no matter what the obstacle and you will succeed.</span></li>
  <li>Eagles do not eat dead things. They feed only on fresh prey. 
<br><span class="link">Lesson: Be careful with what you feed your eyes and ears on. Do your research well and get rid of old and outdated information.</span></li>
  <li>Eagles love the storm. When clouds gather, the eagles get excited while other birds hide in the leaves and branches of the trees. The eagles use the storm's winds to lift them higher. Once they find the wing of the storm, eagles use the raging storm to lift them above the clouds.
 <br><span class="link">Lesson: We can use the storms of life to rise to greater heights. Achievers relish challenges and use them profitably.</span></li>
  <li>The female eagle tests for commitment before it trusts. When a female eagle meets a male and they want to mate, she flies down to earth with the male pursuing her and she picks a twig. She flies back into the air with the male pursuing her. Once she has reached a height high enough for her, she lets the twig fall to the ground and watches it as it falls. The male chases after the twig. The faster it falls, the faster he chases it. He has to catch it before it falls to the ground. He then brings it back to the female eagle. This goes on for hours, with the height increasing until the female eagle is assured that the male eagle has mastered the art of catching the twig which shows commitment. Then and only then, will she allow him to mate with her.
<br><span class="link">Lesson: Whether in private life or in business, one should test commitment of people intended for partnership.</span></li>
  <li>In its forties, an eagleâ€™s feathers become weak and cannot take it as fast as they should. Its beak and talons become bent and blunt. The eagle then takes a journey to the top of the mountains where it plucks off its beak, talons and feathers and new feathers, beak and talons grow. After about 5 months, the eagle comes out of its hiding place and lives for thirty more years.
<br><span class="link">Lesson: We sometimes need to get rid of old memories, habits and other past traditions. Only freed from past burdens, can we take advantage of the present.</span></li>
  <li>When ready to lay eggs, the female and male eagle identify a place very high on a cliff where no predators can reach and the male builds a nest. He picks thorns and lays them on the crevice of the cliff, and then he collects twigs which he lays in the intended nest. He picks thorns laying them on top of the twigs then he picks soft grass to cover the thorns then he picks more thorns, lays them on the nest; picks some more grass to lay on top of the thorns, then finally plucks his feathers to complete the nest. The thorns on the outside of the nest protect it from possible intruders. Both male and female eagles participate in raising the eagle family. She lays the eggs and protects them; he builds the nest and hunts. When old enough to fly, the mother eagle throws the eaglets out of the nest. Because they are scared, they jump back into the nest. Next, she throws them out and then takes off the soft layers of the nest, leaving the thorns bare. When the scared eaglets jump into the nest, they are pricked by thorns. Shrieking and bleeding they jump out wondering why the mother and father who love them so much are torturing them. Next, mother eagle pushes them off the cliff into the air. As they shriek in fear, father eagle flies out and catches them up on his back before they fall and brings them back to the cliff. This goes on for sometime until they start flapping their wings.
<br><span class="link">Lesson: Active participation of both partners leads to success. Being comfortable where we are may result in us not experiencing life, not progressing and not learning at all. The thorns of life come to teach us that we need to grow, get out of the comfort zone and explore the world. We may not know it but the seemingly comfortable and safe haven may have thorns. The people who love us in their seemingly bad actions, have good intentions for us and do not let us languish in sloth but push us hard to grow and prosper.</span></li>
